    <h1>Tech Training Tracker</h1>
    <p class="lead">So you want to be a software developer. You have to put in the work. Training and certifications. Code, code, code! Using C#, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I've created this web application to allow you to track potential and ongoing training courses, completed certifications, and the skills (and what level) you have earned. As I continue to grow and learn I will add to this app.</p>
